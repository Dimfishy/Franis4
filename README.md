Franis 4: The Quest For Peace

Project file is in "Template-File" branch

Okay guys so in the project file just dump your assets accordingly, models and sprites in images, audio sources in audio,
etc etc

just hold off on adding you scene to the build settings until we get a ways into the project, so when you want to play/edit
your scenes just do it manually
